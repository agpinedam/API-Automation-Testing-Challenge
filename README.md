# API-Automation-Testing-Challenge

This is the API challenge

The application under test is “The movie database API” which you can find at https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction
You can see the real-life use of this API here: https://www.themoviedb.org/
Note that you have to create an account, request a key and other steps in order to properly use this API.

The mandatory features to cover with the automated tests are
• test.Authentication
• Lists:
	o Get Details
	o Create test.List
	o Add Movie
	o Clear test.List
	o Delete test.List
• test.Movies:
	o Get Details
	o Rate Movie
Plus, one additional feature to implement a test case. You decide.

Deliverables
• Description of the test cases implemented (could it be with BDD, Normal description of a test case). Think about this, if I was your PO and you were going to explain me your test cases.
• Implementation of the test cases and Execution.

Implementation Constrains
• The implementation must be developed in Java 8+
• Technologies:
• Java 8
• Maven
• Rest Assured
• JUnit or TestNG
• Note: feel free to use any other technology you want
• Follow good programming practices
• Use git and share your project in a GitHub repo

Note: The program consists of: the features folder where the test cases written in cucumber are located, the test folder that contains the test cases, the utils folder with classes that help create the test cases and the models folder that contains pojos for the creation of the json body
