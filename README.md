# API-Automation-Testing-Challenge

This is the API challenge

The application under test is “The movie database API” which you can find at https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction
You can see the real-life use of this API here: https://www.themoviedb.org/
Note that you have to create an account, request a key and other steps in order to properly use this API.

The mandatory features to cover with the automated tests are
• test.Authentication
• Lists:
	o Get Details
	o Create test.List
	o Add Movie
	o Clear test.List
	o Delete test.List
• test.Movies:
	o Get Details
	o Rate Movie
Plus, one additional feature to implement a test case. You decide.

Deliverables
• Description of the test cases implemented (could it be with BDD, Normal description of a test case). Think about this, if I was your PO and you were going to explain me your test cases.
• Implementation of the test cases and Execution.

Implementation Constrains
• The implementation must be developed in Java 8+
• Technologies:
• Java 8
• Maven
• Rest Assured
• JUnit or TestNG
• Note: feel free to use any other technology you want
• Follow good programming practices
• Use git and share your project in a GitHub repo
